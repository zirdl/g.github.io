# Alt + Tab
Presenting **Alt+Tab**, a series covering ways to mitigate the exploitative nature of the internet with the aid of Free and Open-Source Softwares (FOSS) alternatives. Software with open-source codes are the ones that are developed and maintained by the community, which means there are no sketchy code that will exploit the chillness of the end user inside you.

A plethora of FOSS alternatives developed by the community are waiting for someone like you to use them. By using, I also mean appreciation and maybe even contribution to these projects because the community who's developing those open-source projects are dependent to itself. The author who created a particular open-source project also dedicated it for the community, for free. Almost every mundane service and computing software that you're using as a casual end user has a free and open-source counterpart. And maybe you're even using one now, or at least have used FOSS at a point in your life. A few examples are: [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/), [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), and of course, Linux, which has its own flavors. Here's the link to the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/about/) if you want to learn more.

## Part I: For my Fellow Audiophiles
I, for once, subscribed to Spotify's premium plan for students, amounting to 75 pesos per month. Subscribing to this plan means inputting your student e-mail that leads to the disclosure of your academic, and maybe even personal information (*the totality of you being a student*), and that you might be also contributing to the exploitable surface of your University's network for hackers to target; pragmatic, but true. Furthermore, subscribing to these services just to **eliminate ads** is unnecessary for someone like me as there <u>exists a plethora of ways to avoid and eliminate those annoying ads for free</u>; and when we say *free* in the open-source community, we mean **freedom**. I'm not suppressing your will to subscribe to the said products, if you feel that you're safe, or maybe you fancy the convenience, then no one should call you out for subscribing. These are merely my ways of going against data capitalists from having a record of my music taste â€” which also happens to be a powerful psychological candy to keep our eyes **and ears** steadily glued on the platform.

## On Desktop
### A) YouTube with uBlock Origin
While YouTube's a total crap on mobile because we users have no power over the app's ability to splook (*yes, this is actually a word*) ads unto us, this power [to block ads] is actually present when we're using our Web browsers on our desktop computers to binge-watch, or even **listen to music**. The scope of blocking ads in our web browsers are not limited on YouTube, or any other website, but once you've installed an ad-blocker, preferably uBlock Origin, it will block all advertisements on every website you'll come across to visit. You should find uBlock Origin in [Chrome Webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm), and if you're using Firefox, you can find it in [Mozilla Add-ons store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)

If you're interested in diving deep into ad-blockin with uBlock Origin, you might want to watch [this video by TheHatedOne](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=2lisQQmWQkY) on YouTube.
