Final decision: it'll be a Google Pixel 5. I might install [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/#about) onto it, like a paranoid teenage anarchist.

Migrated my second brain from [Neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg) to pure [Markdown](https://markdownguide.org). Of course, its still a wiki, the only thing na hindi ko magawa sa Neorg is to export the file directly into a pdf one. Need ko pang gamitan ng `pandoc` just to convert the markdown exported from a `.norg` file to produce a decent, columned pdf. I'm also planning to write a post showcasing my setup and process of note-taking using <u>Markdown on Neovim</u>.
