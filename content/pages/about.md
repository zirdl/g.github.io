I'm **Gio**, a second year student of the **College of Information Systems** at [Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University, North La Union Campus, Philippines](https://www.dmmmsu.edu.ph/category/campus/nluc/).

I'm also a student-journalist, currently standing as the Chief Layout Artist of the Green Valley Treasure. I mainly do my work with **free and open-source software**. As for my line on writing, I do write **Development Communication**, **Feature**, and **Opinion** articles. I might also have a taste on photography.

This little static website of mine was born to **share what I do without relying heavily on social media or any other service limiting my granular control.** This sudden burst of desire to publish my work online was largely inspired by reading **Austin Kleon's** **[Show Your Work.](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/)** Here's a quote from the book that might also resonate with you 😉.

*"Carving out a space for yourself online, somewhere where you can express yourself and share your work, is still one of the best possible investments you can make with your time."*
