I'm **Gio**, a second year student, student-athlete, and a student-journalist from the **College of Information Systems** of [Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University North La Union Campus, Philippines](https://www.dmmmsu.edu.ph/category/campus/nluc/).

This little platform of mine was born to **share what I do without relying heavily on social media.** This sudden burst of desire to publicize my work was largely inspired by reading **Austin Kleon's** **[Show Your Work.](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/)** Here's a quote from the book that triggered the inception of this website:

{% admonition(type="quote", title="A. Kleon") %}

*Carving out a space for yourself online, somewhere where you can express yourself and share your work, is still one of the best possible investments you can make with your time.*
