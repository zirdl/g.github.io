In our 'Organization and Management' subject with Prof. Shalimar Navalta, we were instructed to present a "dreamboard"— _piece of paper containing pasted images of desired possessions_, or rather how we see ourselves after 10 years on a 22.5 x 18.5 inches piece of cartolina paper. But I'm not artistic enough to compile all my fantasies on that limited size of paper, so I figured **I'll follow our Instructor's instructions, but do it the 'me' way?**

**I created this static website to write my: life roadmap, plans, opinions, insights, and other personal stuff that might help me choose the right decision and make the 10-years-from-now Gio a lot clearer.**

# Expected Timeline
![alt-tect](/imgs/expected.png)
## Year: 2026

**Age: 22**
This will be one of the significant events in my life, as I will finally get my Bachelor's Degree of Science in Information Systems. Opportunities shouldn't be taken for granted, and with this event, I can finally say that **I made it**. Throughout studying, I might also consider building a robust workspace set-up of mine.

## Year: 2026 - 2027
**Age: 22 - 23**
Within this span of months (or maybe a year), I will take my time to breath, as my student-era has come to an end. I might apply for a job to prepare for the preceding desired jobs/businesses of mine.

## Year: 2027 - 2029

**Age: 23 - 25**
**Work... Workk... Workkk...**

I will be entering the professional field, I will apply for jobs related to my expertise and strive to make the best out of it. I might also choose to work abroad since tech jobs abroad are much more reliable in terms of compensation.

**Broom! Broom! Peep!**
Then I'll buy a car, I like pick-up trucks specifically the brands—Ford, Nissan, Chevrolet, or just a Toyota.

# The Succeeding Years

The Following years, I might plan to enter a romantic relationship. Builing [Dream house](https://www.pinoyhouseplans.com/mateo-four-bedroom-two-story-house-plan/) or acquiring my own condominium unit might come into place regardless if I'm married or not. A **self-sustained lifestyle** shouldn't also be neglected. I'll continue then, to enjoy what life has to throw at me. Below are some of my ideal designs and particular setting for a house, designed by [PinoyBahayIdeas](https://www.facebook.com/pinoybahayideas?__tn__=-UC*F) on Facebook.
