* **Pros** 
  * I'm forced to use my Linux-powered laptop; which gave me:
    * Absolute control over the content I'm consuming
    * Ad-free experience
    * Zero proprietary software or bloatware
    * Peace of mind that my files aren't secretly synced to someones computer (I'm talking 'bout you Microshit)
  * I had an indispensable excuse to avoid annoying people making phone calls out of the blue
  * A great way to take a break from social media; no camera, no notifications, no bullshit.
