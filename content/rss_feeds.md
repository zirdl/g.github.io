*"RSS enables us to break free from the information overload and take control of our online consumption. It's a game-changer for both publishers and readers."*

## I. Why You'd Want This:
In this digital age, where print media is seen as just another 'hassle'; where social media capitalizes on people's attention to feed assorted volumes of information, we cannot afford to fall on its distracting, clout-driven, proprietary, and algorithm-powered nature as a daily source of quality and credible news.

If you like to be **precise and conscious** on the information you're consuming, it would be best to have a tool that you yourself can configure to aggregate updates from various websites you'd choose to follow. This can take place without the expense of setting up an account on a social media platform and dealing with its overwhelming algorithmic nature. Journalists, Tech enthusiasts, or just normal people who just wants to follow updates from their frequently visited sites; **anyone who choose to have control over their consumption, would want to aggregate RSS Feeds**.

### WTF is an RSS Feed?
**Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds** are basically just files that get updated every time a website publishes a new content. This file now contains details from the name of the author, date published, link, the content's summary, or even the whole content. Now we can see how direct this is: from the writers/creators straight to your RSS Feed aggregator, this happens without any middle party, except for the internet itself. Content arrives at your doorstep without the creeping force of analytics and algorithm, simply because you called [chose] for these content to arrive.

## II. How can I aggregate a feed then?
{%admonition (type="note", title="Free and Open-Source?") %}
**Free and Open-Source Software** are pieces of software that are distributed for freeâ€”in the context of moneyâ€”and having its source code available for anyone; to audit, secure, or maybe even edit it according to their taste. Therefore, **FREEDOM!**

Building your feed is **as simple as copy and pasting links**. But first, we need to talk about what you should be **copying**, and **where you'll be pasting it**. Of course there are ***shortcuts*** [Feedly, Google Feeds, etc.] on this field of reading 'news feeds', you can even utilize the power of Artificial Intelligence for this specific job. But most of these services are, again, ***appealing to your recent searches, interests, and even scooping data from your other applications*** [*yes, they can do that*] just to deliver you pieces of filtered information, tailored to your impulses.

### RSS Feed Aggregators
This [piece of software] is where you'll be pasting, or importing the RSS feeds you've gathered yourself. There are quite diverse methods out there to aggregate feeds [i.e. using a self-hosted client], but this article is limited on using local mobile and desktop applications only.

### 1. On Mobile

### What should I look for, to copy an RSS feed?
{%admonition (type="tip", title="The RSS symbol and atom.xml files")%}
ðŸ›œ <- this is the closest character I can find for the RSS feed symbol that you can find **rarely** on mainstream websites. But you can find the exact symbol of this on the [homepage](/) of this website, its with the icons just below my short intro.
